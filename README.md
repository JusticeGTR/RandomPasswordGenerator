# HW3 - Random Password Generator

This is our third homework assignment in nu-chi-fsf-ft-03-2021-u-c! 

In this excercise, we were tasked with creating our own random password generator capable of creating a password of various lengths and specific characters. 

Acceptance criteria:
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

This is a tough one, but honestly a little more satisfying than CSS.
